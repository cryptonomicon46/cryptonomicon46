I am a seasoned web3 security specialist and adept smart contract developer with a proven track record. Leveraging my background as an audit apprentice at `0xMacroSecurity`, I am well-equipped to offer insights and solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of web3 technology.

Feel free to reach out for private audits or tailored consultations on web3 smart contracts. It's worth noting that larger audit firms often juggle numerous projects simultaneously, which might prevent your project from receiving the focused attention it warrants.

Here's my commitment to you: I can facilitate a swift preliminary audit complemented by remediation strategies at a competitive rate. This step could be vital before you engage with a larger firm, potentially avoiding long waiting lists. Rest assured, I prioritize giving your project the utmost priority, with a steadfast focus on ensuring maximal security and quality.

Looking forward to collaborating with you to fortify the security and success of your venture.
